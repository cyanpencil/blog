# Dreamctf

I just published dreamctf, a new ctf framework I used for internal training at team flagbot!

You can try a live version [here](http://dreamctf.cyanpencil.xyz)!

Pokemon and colortheme should be random at each refresh. 

Here you can see a couple of screenshots:

Making the pokemon matching the overall theme of the colorscheme was incredibly hard!

I needed to convert the colors from RGB to HSV, to compute operations on them such as the mean. 
Our eyes work really different than computers when perceiving colors, so this was quite hard to make!

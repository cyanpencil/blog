# JUST

We are given a binary named `JUST` and an endpoint `nc just.chal.perfect.blue 1337`.

We run the binary (in a docker sandbox) to see what's up:
```
$ ./JUST
cat: motd.ansi: No such file or directory
Enter a URL:
```
at this point, we try entering `http://google.com` and we get as response:
```
Enter a URL: http://google.com
Retrieving http://google.com
```

Alright, let's look at the binary :)

This is a screen of the start of the `main` function (some variable names were
inserted by me while reversing:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2021-10-18_886x672.png)

As you can see, not much happens other than a call to libcurl to retrieve
the contents of an http endpoint.
Let's go further down `main`:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2021-10-18_1001x925.png)

Ah, we see that the data retrieved by curl is being passed to a curious
function called `meme`, 8 bytes at a time, xoring the result of a call to
`meme` with the input for the next call (This reminds of how CBC block ciphers
work). 

_Note to the reader: the 'meme' function name was not put by me. It was already
there in the binary_.

The output of the `meme` is then passed to a function called `sha1digest`. The result
of the hash is then compared to _something_, and then if we pass all those checks the first 8 bytes of the result of `meme` are sent to `system()` (not included in the screenshot).

### Now, what does the meme function do? 

Good question. It's a question that bothered us of _a long while_. 
Let's have a look at it with IDA:

	</center>
</figure>

Uh-Oh. That does not look good. 

Let's have a look at the disassembly:

	<figcaption>The pokemini in all it's glory</figcaption>
	</center>
</figure>


Ummm... it's a huge, single, massive basic block that contains half a million instructions. No good. 

At first we tried to _guess_ what the meme function did, trying stuff like AES or DES or whatever. This, did not work. We tried many things but `meme` looked like it was doing random stuff.

### what do

So at this point I decided to have a deeper look at how the function was composed. The fact that there was basically no control flow (being a single solid massive basic block), complicated things a lot, and sent us in the direction of this being something similar to movfuscator.

Let's have a look at the instructions:

	</center>
</figure>

The function was mostly made of patterns like the above. A few things were different each time, 
like doing `and` instead of `or`, and some bit inversions with some `xors`.

After a while I realized that this line could basically be translated to:
```
mem[0xd63] =  input[0x3] | input[0x2]
```

Soon enough, we realized the program was just doing simple boolean logic operations on a
64 bit long bitvector. Patterns were very similar and I started writing a lifter to 
express better the logic of whatever `meme` was doing. 

Spoiler: this took a long time. I ended up parsing the disassembly of `meme` in python. This was not a smart idea, but around 4 hours later, I had a 200+ lines python script that took the half a million lines of disassembly and outputted 50k lines of the following:

```
mem[0xcf5] =  ~input[0x4] & input[0x5]
mem[0xd63] =  input[0x3] | input[0x2]
mem[0xdd2] =  input[0x2] & ~input[0x3]
mem[0xe41] =  input[0] | input[0x1]
mem[0xeb0] =  mem[0xdd2] & ~mem[0xe41]
mem[0xf1f] =  mem[0xd63] & ~mem[0xeb0]
mem[0xffd] =  ~mem[0xf8e] ^ input[0x6]
mem[0x106c] =  mem[0xf1f] ^ input[0x4]
mem[0x10db] =  ~mem[0x106c]
...
```
At this time, Robin noticed that no element of the `mem` array was written to more than once. 
This meant that we had to deal with a circuit, or something. I did not put a lot of weight
on this, and it was a mistake on my part :)

I went on to waste 2/3 hours on trying a tool called `MBA-blast` that should simplify mixed-boolean
arithmetic expression, hoping that it could help us understand this mangled mess. But it did 
not work at all and just made me **frustrated**. 

We tried pinging random teammates on discord, hoping they had a magic solution somewhere.

But, sadly, did not work either.

### The lift, the crane, and the z.

At this point I was on 10+ hours into this challenge, and my mental sanity was almost completely
drained. I ran out of insults and curses to throw at the challenge author, in every language I knew of. The situation was critical.

Out of the blue, Robin came in with a _desperate_ suggestion: "why don't you just try z3?"

<figure>

	<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2021-10-18_1322x1180.png" width="50%" alt="Good stuff"/>

	</center>
</figure>

Now, you see, z3. never. works. Like angr. You just waste hours on hours on setting them up,
and they hang somewhere solving who knows what constraint. 

Anyway, I was so desperate I decided to go with it. I wrote another lifter, that did the following:
```
mem[0xffd] =  ~mem[0xf8e] ^ input[0x6] => mem_0xffd_ = z3.Xor(z3.Not(mem_0xf8e, input_0x6))
```
for every single boolean logic operator. 
This took around one hour. 

### Pain. Sorrow. Regret. Hopelessness.

Very surprisingly, z3 finished very fast. Unfortunately, the result was wrong. To be a bit more specific, we were using z3 to build a pre-image of the `meme` function. In other words, we asked z3 to give us the correct input to give to `meme` such that the output would be the string `/bin/sh;`; but when we plugged the input z3 gave us, it was wrong. 

Unfortunately, there were, let's just say, _multiple_ bugs in my lifting scripts.

</figure>

I was not in my happiest mood, as I would prefer being hit by a school bus and forced to use Windows for the rest of my life instead of having to debug a z3 script on a meme function. 

After two gruesome hours spent unhealthily staring at assembly and python, we were still stuck.

### Redemption

All of a sudden, Andy came in _clutch_ by finding a flipped condition, and this happened:

	</center>
</figure>

Finally, z3 gave us the correct pre-image. No one could believe it.  Miracles happen.

We then rushed to solve the rest of the chall. To summarize, the `sha1digest` function compared the hash of the first 8 bytes with the following 24 bytes of the output of `meme`. So we basically had to ask z3 for 4 pre-images of the `meme` and we were golden. 

Or at least we thought. Unfortunately, the sha1 hash we inserted did not match the hash outputted
by the `sha1digest` function included in the binary. We soon noticed that the `sha1digest` was 
in fact _not_ `sha1`, as it was a custom implementation in which the author, feeling in a exceptionally funny mood, _changed a few constants, lol!_. My heart is burning with anger. 

Since I ran out of insults against the author, I started cursing his family. To solve this issue we just used gdb and stole what was supposed to be the correct hash, and run z3 again to get the pre-image. 

Finally, we passed all the checks, and we managed to pop a shell on the server. 
This was the flag:

`pbctf{haha_yosys_goes_brrrrrr_ae8135d1}`

Yes! :)


### Addendum 1

Later, the challenge author revealed to us how the `meme` function was created. The tool
the author used is called **yosis**, and is able to synthetize fpga bitstreams from verilog.
It was around 30 lines of verilog, compiled to around half a million x86 instructions.

### Addendum 2

I could have said not-so-nice things about the chall author in this writeup, but the quality 
of his ctf-related memes on his twitter account more than make up for the pain we felt 
while solving this chall.

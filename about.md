# About

Hello

I'm Luca Di Bartolomeo. I easily get _too_ inspired by things.
Sometimes I learn so much; sometimes I just waste time.

&nbsp;

I am currently pursuing a computer science master degree at [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch).

I graduated with honours from [La Sapienza](http://www.uniroma1.it) university in Rome.

I had my fun participating in programming competitions such as the 
[OII](https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=142&Itemid=93&lang=it)
and [Google Hashcode](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode). I also went two times to 
the [SWERC](https://swerc.eu/2018/about/) as a member of my college's team.

I was a student for the 2018 edition of Google Summer of Code, for the [radare](http://www.radare.org) organization.
[Here](https://gist.github.com/cyanpencil/27db326bf6f9d2747297fa9b943eb65b)
there's a list of my contributions. I had an amazing time, and still try to contribute to radare when possible.

I really really enjoy participating in CTF competitions. 
I've participated and placed third in the [Cyberchallenge.it](http://www.cyberchallenge.it) national competition, but
I'm still pretty much a beginner, and always on the lookout for new things to learn.

[This](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dcyzM) is a small cool demo I made in under 500 lines of GLSL.

When I was in high school, I gave a shot at game development by participating in the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) 
competition. 
[One](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=26439)
of our games was quite successful ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjeizyJwREg) of the gameplay).

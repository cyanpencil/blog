<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I’m Luca Di Bartolomeo. I easily get <em>too</em> inspired by things.
Sometimes I learn so much; sometimes I just waste time.</p>

<hr />

<p> </p>

<p>I am currently pursuing a PhD at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch">EPFL Lausanne</a>, in the 
  <a href="https://hexhive.epfl.ch">HexHive</a> research group.</p>

<p>I took my master degree at <a href="https://www.ethz.ch">ETH Zurich</a>; I graduated my bachelor’s with honours from <a href="https://www.uniroma1.it">La Sapienza</a> university in Rome.</p>

<p>I had my fun participating in programming competitions such as the 
<a href="https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=142&amp;Itemid=93&amp;lang=it">OII</a>
and <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode">Google Hashcode</a>. I also went two times to 
the <a href="https://swerc.eu/2018/about/">SWERC</a> as a member of my college’s team.</p>

<p>I was a student for the 2018 edition of Google Summer of Code, for the <a href="http://www.radare.org">radare</a> organization.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/cyanpencil/27db326bf6f9d2747297fa9b943eb65b">Here</a>
there’s a list of my contributions. I had an amazing time, and still try to contribute to radare when possible.</p>

<p>I really really enjoy participating in CTF competitions. 
I’ve participated and placed third in the <a href="http://www.cyberchallenge.it">Cyberchallenge.it</a> national competition, but
I’m still pretty much a beginner, and always on the lookout for new things to learn.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dcyzM">This</a> is a small cool demo I made in under 500 lines of GLSL.</p>

<p>When I was in high school, I gave a shot at game development by participating in the <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> 
competition. 
<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&amp;uid=26439">One</a>
of our games was quite successful (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjeizyJwREg">video</a> of the gameplay).</p>
